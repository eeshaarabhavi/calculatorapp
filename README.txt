**Calculator App**

This app was made to showcase my React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills. 
Some key functionalities:
    - Performs operations such as: 
        -> Addition
        -> Subtraction
        -> Multiplication
        -> Division
        -> Exponent
    - Dynamically resizes the number that is inputed in order to fit the screen

Some bugs this project has:
    - operations need to be cleared after pressing the equals button
    - handling parenthesis was not implemented (possible future implementation)
    - cannot do multiple operations at once (possible future implementation)

How to view the project:
    - running "npm start" after downloading the code should run the project and open your default browser
